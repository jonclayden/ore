Significant changes to the "ore" package are laid out below for each release.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.6.3

- The ore.file() function now performs path expansion on its argument.
- The package is now more careful to check that "external" pointers are valid
  before dereferencing them, thereby avoiding potential segfaults. (Reported
  by Thomas Weise, #5).
- Multiarchitecture support is now explicitly declared, ensuring that 32-bit
  and 64-bit versions are built when installing from source on Windows.
  (Reported by Ioannis Mamalikidis, #6).

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.6.2

- Additional warnings from GCC 8 and rchk have been resolved.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.6.1

- The Onigmo library has been updated to version 6.1.3.
- Various compiler and sanitiser warnings have been resolved.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.6.0

- The Onigmo library has been updated to version 6.1.1.
- Files will now be searched incrementally, meaning that large files do not
  need to be read in their entirety if the match is near the beginning. This is
  disabled by default if all matches are requested.
- Additional arguments to ore.search() are now accessible through an ellipsis
  argument to ore.ismatch().
- The results of a substitution function are now recycled across matches, and
  can therefore be of any length. 
- A handful of subtle garbage-collection heisenbugs have been corrected.
  (Reported by Tomas Kalibera.)

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.5.0

- The object returned by ore.search() now generally has the class "orematches".
  This class has its own indexing and print methods to avoid copious output and
  allow quicker access to multiple matches.
- The ore.search() and ore.split() functions now accept zero-length text
  vectors, returning an empty list rather than producing an error.
- The matches() and groups() functions now use the last match by default, if
  called with no argument.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.4.0

- The new ore.escape() function can be used to escape characters which would
  usually have special significance in a regular expression. This can be
  helpful when incorporating arbitrary strings into a regex using ore().

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.3.0

- It is now possible to search directly in text files, using their native
  encoding, or in binary files, byte-by-byte. To do this, a call to the new
  ore.file() function should replace the usual text argument to ore.search().
  All of Onigmo's many encodings are supported for text files.
- A new infix operator, %~|%, can be used filter vectors by whether they match
  a regular expression.
- The "matches" and "groups" methods for lists now drop nonmatching elements by
  default. This helps avoid many NULLs in results.
- The "print" method for "orematch" objects now works correctly with
  double-width characters.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.2.2

- Zero-length matches could lead to segmentation faults. This has been
  corrected.
- Calls to ore.dict() which include other function calls are now handled
  properly. (Reported by Jon Olav Vik.)
- The es() function would previously only honour its rounding arguments if all
  matches were numeric. This has been corrected.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.2.1

- The es() function would previously only replace the first embedded
  expression. That has been corrected.
- Attributes are now ignored when comparing "ore" objects in tests. This led to
  a failure on versions of R prior to 3.2.0, at least on Windows.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.2.0

- Oniguruma's support for alternative regular expression syntaxes is now
  exposed by the ore() function. At present only "fixed" (i.e., literal)
  patterns are supported in addition to the default, which has always been
  "ruby".
- The ore.lastmatch() function gains a "simplify" argument.
- Underscore-separated function names are now available as aliases to their
  period-separated equivalents. For example, you can use ore_search() instead
  of ore.search(), if you prefer.
- The use of variables holding patterns could sometimes cause errors in ore().
  This has been corrected.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.1.0

- The package now provides functionality for creating and working with a
  pattern dictionary, and a few predefined patterns are included. This allows
  common regular expressions to be easily named, stored, and integrated into
  larger expressions later. The key new function is ore.dict().
- The new es() function provides expression substitution, a convenient way to
  embed R expressions within strings, and a good example of the package's
  substitution functions in action.
- Printing of "orematch" objects is now much clearer, particularly for long or
  multiline search texts.
- Group matches are now passed to substitution functions, in an attribute.
- The "ore.colour" (or "ore.color") option can now be used to determine whether
  to print in colour, rather than using the crayon package (although the latter
  is still the default).

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.7

- Printing "orematch" objects no longer leads to errors. This was due to a
  mismatch in function names between the C code and the calling R code.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.6

- All of the core functions have now switched to primarily C implementations,
  providing substantial performance gains. Minor changes in the handling of
  text encodings have occurred alongside this.
- The limit of 128 matches per string has been removed, due to more
  sophisticated memory management.
- The arguments to ore.subst() have been reordered slightly, to avoid
  inadvertent partial matching when using a substitution function.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.5

- Calculation of match offsets within the C code have been made much more
  efficient.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.4

- Default methods have been added for matches() and groups(), which return NA.
- The "rex" test is now skipped if that package is not available.
- Various low-level warnings/errors from UBSAN have been addressed.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.3

- Almost all of the work of ore.search() is now done in C code rather than R,
  for performance. In testing, ore is now appreciably faster than base R for
  simple searches, when the regex is precompiled. Optimisation of other
  functions will follow in later releases.
- The package no longer requires any specified minimum version of R (although
  it has not been tested on old releases).

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.2

- A bug in the ore.subst() function that could produce low-level errors or
  segmentation faults has been fixed.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.1

- Tests should no longer fail in locales which do not use a UTF-8 encoding.
- Documentation tweaks.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.0

- First public release.

===============================================================================
